## Part 2

#### Position: TEAM LEADER SUPPORT

1. Analyze the current state of aiesec.org as a platforms. What would you start, stop, continue and improve?

>+ start: 
>   1. Ad release notes/Pre-iteration meetup (support team really want prepare before meet new bug or all new bug support goes to developers)
>   2. Adding articles about improvement BEFORE the release
>   2. Implement the issue solving process

>+ stop:
>   1. Use developers as high level administrators and delegate responsibility to actions in expa and admins
>   2. Focus on GUI rather than processes' improvement tasks

>+ improve:
>   1. Communication between supports and testers team
>   2. Delegate the expa checking function(LC email, links, etc) to someone and actualise the information

>+ continue
>	1. Use s3.amazon
>	2. Use CI(I hope it happen)      

2. How would you manage and motivate your team to build a support function for aiesec.org using intercom’s features to ensure 24hrs (or less) response? Explain in detail.

>Actually, it isn't about motivation but effective work. The main goal for support team is satisfied customers. I f we focus on it we have to divide our team spending times to active picks base on hours statisticks from [this link](https://app.intercom.io/a/apps/jadbzc02/respond/insights?grouping=hour&rangeEnd=2017-07-18T23%3A59%3A59%2B01%3A00&rangeStart=2017-07-18T00%3A00%3A00%2B01%3A00) or [this link](https://app.intercom.io/a/apps/jadbzc02/respond/insights?grouping=hour&rangeEnd=2017-08-18T23%3A59%3A59%2B01%3A00&rangeStart=2017-05-27T00%3A00%3A00%2B01%3A00). Also, diversity is required in our case. We need Spanish,Chinese, Portuguese, French, German and Arabic speaker for answer in some of applications. Of course, collaboration  help use to answer more and better, get help from colleagues, get pleasure from the process, etc.   


3. AIESEC.ORG is maintained by our vendor Commutatus. Currently they have one of their developers on intercom to allow for upscaling of issues. How would you envision a smooth work relationship that ensures swift and fast solving of bugs? Please include your role, the role of the developer, the role of the AI IM Manager, as well as entities support agents using the platform.

>About developers. So strange choice, i visit they [website](http://www.commutatus.com) and see that time for loading new simple page is about 6(!) second. Also they have animation that hide the example picture when you scroll on it. According to [LinkedIn profile](https://in.linkedin.com/company/commutatus) they have 1-10 developers and I’m not sure if they have testers, business analytics, etc. Also I don't know how the process builded in the company (Scrum, XP, Indian trash, etc.). I talk about close work between testers and support, also, it will be awesome if support can track the bugfix process in jira without AI IM asking. 
>Next talk about the roles:
>1. **AI IM Manager** is product owner. He is prioritise the tasks from backlog and plan the strategy of the product.
>1. **Entities support agents** is responsible to local issue: *"Please, assign EP manager to me!"*, *"Help me with VISA getting process?"*, *"How to pay the fee?"*, *etc*. This is mostly about provide information. If they can't do something than they delegate it to Global support team. 
>1. **Global support team** is responsible for global issue: Delete account, Identify bug and add it to bug tracking system, help with site navigation and process steps. They include information and administration activity. If they can't do something than they delegate it to Global support team leader.
>1. **Global support team leader** is responsible for the team result  and the most difficult issues.
>1. **Developers** have to develope and nothing more :-)
